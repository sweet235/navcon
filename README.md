# Unvanquished Navcons

These files provide connections between otherwise disconnected bot
navmeshes.

## Installing

Let us assume your server's home directory is `$SVH`. Put the files *.navcon
into the directory `$SVH/game/maps`. After that, the server will load
the appropriate files on map change.
